<h4>Smashburgers - A great summertime favorite for the family, consisting of juicy and tasty goodness!</h4>

<p>"Smash Burgers are not a thick, exquisitely grilled, medium-rare burger. They are not a lovingly crafted, perfectly symmetrical patty made with the most expensive cuts of beef and a heavily guarded spice mix. They are minced beef and salt, smashed flat over a searingly hot flat-grill until you get a crispy, craggy-edged, asymmetric, cooked-through patty that is juicy, caramelised, beefy and, frankly, the best burger you are ever going eat."</p>
